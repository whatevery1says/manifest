# Scripts

This folder contains a Python scripts for working with manifest files. Currently, there is just one script, `validate.py`. This is a command line tool for validating manifests against the schema. A typical usage might be something like

```
python validate.py ../schema/v2.0/Corpus.schema.json ../schema/v2.0/tests/Corpus.json
```
