# The WE1S manifest schema

This schema is a set of recommendations, examples, and validation tools for the construction of manifest documents for the [WhatEvery1Says Project (WE1S)](https://we1s.ucsb.edu/).

A manifest is a JSON document which describes resources. These documents can be used as data storage and configuration files for a variety of scripted processes and tools that read the JSON format. Manifests may include metadata describing a publication, a process, a set of data, or an output of some procedure. Their primary intent is to help humans document and keep track of their workflow.

The WE1S project uses digital humanities methods to study public discourse about the humanities at large data scales, with a particular focus on collections of documents such as newspaper articles and social media posts. WE1S uses the schema to define metadata around individual articles, collections, sources, and corpora, as well as projects modeling collections of documents. Manifests also describe software tools, processes, and workflows, as well outputs such as result data, information visualizations, and interactive interfaces.
