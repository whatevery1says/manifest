# The WE1S manifest schema

This schema is a set of recommendations, examples, and validation tools for the construction of manifest documents for the [WhatEvery1Says Project (WE1S)](https://we1s.ucsb.edu/). The WE1S project uses the manifest schema to define metadata around individual documents, collections, sources, and corpora, as well as projects modeling collections of documents.

A manifest is a JSON document which describes resources. These documents can be used as data storage and configuration files for a variety of scripted processes and tools that read the JSON format. Manifests may include metadata describing a publication, a process, a set of data, or an output of some procedure. Manifests can also describe software tools, processes, and workflows, as well outputs such as result data, information visualizations, and interactive interfaces. Their primary intent is to help humans document and keep track of their workflow.

Full documentation for the manifest schema is available at [https://whatevery1says.github.io/manifest/](https://whatevery1says.github.io/manifest/).
